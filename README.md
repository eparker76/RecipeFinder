# RecipeFinder
Recipe Finder is a proof of concept for a recipe website made in a group project for my agile development class. The website sought to solve the issue we had with recipe sites in that it was a pain in the butt to get to the recipe. You'd have to scroll through someone's life story just to get to the part you care about. We wanted a website that removed all the fluff. You click on a recipe and boom there it is, no need to dig through the page to find it. 

This project was made using the ASP.Net
